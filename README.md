 # Rice Configs
A repository for my configuration dotfiles (window manager configurations and such) (currently hyprland config and wallpaper at the moment)

# Wallpaper Download:
I got my wallpaper from [this website](https://www.wallpaperflare.com/nord-theme-city-lights-building-night-street-light-wallpaper-yruqy/download), feel free to download it.

If you prefer Windows wallpapers, please head over to [this link](https://www.deviantart.com/windowsaesthetics/art/Ultimate-Windows-Wallpaper-Pack-942163195) to download the wallpapers. (There is a 2 GB and a 12 GB version of said files, the 2 GB one is of course smaller and only includes ones from the official Windows releases; the 12 GB one has more stuff like MS Office wallpapers and other exclusive stuff, feel free to choose between the 2 versions.)

***DISCLAIMER***: The themes here are *strictly* nord-themed **only**. Links to Windows wallpapers is provided, but is *optional*.

# Font Download:
Ideally, use [this font](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases/download/v3.1.0/JetBrainsMono.zip) from [this website](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads). There are also a bunch more cool fonts available there, feel free to choose whatever font you like and switch it for the font that I use instead.
You can use the font that I've provided in the files (beware that it is from Google, commercial use is a huge NO-NO for them), but please exercise caution, so you won't get your butt chased by Google. **WARNING:** *I understand that this is purely FOSS and such, but please use commercial software with caution, to avoid copyright issues.*
