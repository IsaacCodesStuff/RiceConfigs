# Rice Configs
A repository for my configuration dotfiles (window manager configurations and such) (currently hyprland config and wallpaper at the moment)

# Wallpaper Download:
I got my wallpaper from [this website](https://www.wallpaperflare.com/nord-theme-city-lights-building-night-street-light-wallpaper-yruqy/download), feel free to download it

***DISCLAIMER***: The themes here are *strictly* nord-themed **only**.

# Nerd Font Download:
Ideally, use [this font](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases/download/v3.1.0/JetBrainsMono.zip) from [this website](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads). There are also a bunch more cool fonts available there, feel free to choose whatever font you like and switch it for the font that I use instead.
